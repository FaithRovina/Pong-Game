# Pong-Game
This is a classic game built using Python and the Turtle module. 
The game is designed to be played by two players, with each player controlling a paddle on either side of the screen.
The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

How to play
1. To start the game, run the main.py file in your Python environment. 
The game window will open  and you will see the two paddles and the ball in the centre of the
screen.
2. To control the left paddle use 'u' for up and 'd' for down.
To control the right paddle, use 'PgUp' key and the 'PgDn' key to move down.

Files:
main.py - contains the logic  and code to run the game
ball.py - defines the behavior of the ball
paddle.py - defines the behavior of the paddle
scoreboard.py - handles the scores of the two players in the game.

Requirements
This game requires Python 3 and Turtle module installed.
